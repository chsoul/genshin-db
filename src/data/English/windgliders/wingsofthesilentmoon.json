	"story": "It is a tale passed down among the fae, told during their gatherings beneath the moon.\nSuch moonlit gatherings are an ancient rite. Some say the practice dates back to an age when the true moon hung in the sky, and perhaps the beings who gathered beneath it were not fae at all. In any case, gazing at the moon and speaking of times old and new is considered by the boldest among them to be the perfect moment for sharing secrets.\nAnd among all the tales they tell, there is one they love the most:\n\nAccording to legend, the king of the Fae of the Snowlands — a hero born from the bones of a great beast — sought to unite the entire continent. To do so, he had to slay his final enemy.\nYet that enemy could neither age nor die, for his life was hidden far from his body. No matter how many times the king of the snowy realms struck him down, he would rise again from the shadows.\nSo, the spirit of frost and a traveler from beyond the palace walls set out to seek the truth of this foe. At last, they learned how he might be killed.\nTo kill the enemy, the Snow-King would need to find a fissure buried deep in the earth's darkest strata. Within that crack lay a tree that grew downward. Upon the tree's tower-like branches perched a raven. Within the raven's belly lay a snow-white hare. In the hare's eyes was a door. And if he opened that door, a world as black as spilled ink would pour forth, swallowing both heaven and earth. In that world, everything was still. There was no light, and no sound. The Snow-King would have to cross that silent realm alone and, at its lightless heart, find an egg.\nThis egg held the essence of his enemy's life. Shatter it, and the immortal enemy would be reduced to dust.\nThe task did not seem too difficult up to the moment of opening the door, or so the snow-realm's king thought. But how was he going to cross that realm of pitch-black silence?\nSo, the spirit of frost and the traveler wove two wings of ancient moonlight for him.\n\nThis, then, may have been the wind glider that could carry one through the silent void. Yet the old moonlight has long since lost its radiance, and the snow-realm king who once used them has vanished from history. What remains today functions no better than an ordinary wind glider. In fact, since wind gliders were invented far later than the age of the Snow-King, this entire tale may well be a fanciful explanation someone crafted to justify the glider's existence.\n\nAnd how did the snow-realm king meet his end, you ask?\nSome say that when he shattered the egg, he finally saw the truth: His greatest enemy bore his face.\nOthers claim the egg never existed, and that the world beyond the door was nothing more than a trap meant to keep him in the void.\nThere are far too many versions to count. But it does not matter. For in this tale of wings...\nThe ending was never the part that mattered the most.",
