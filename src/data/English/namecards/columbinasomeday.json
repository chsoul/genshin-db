	"description": "Namecard style.\nShe dances in the shallows of clear streams and drifts with the current, falling asleep beneath the pale shadows of the mountains. She wanders through the ripples of time, playing hide-and-seek with the kuuhenki.\nShe rests in the garden of all things, humming softly to every living creature. In the quiet hours before dawn, she waits for the day of their reunion.",
