	"description": "An elegant elemental life form that possesses immense elemental affinity. The long years have exposed it to high concentrations of Geo, resulting in its present form.\nJust about its entire body is covered by the accumulated Geo, while its tough antlers gleam with the luster of polished amber.\nIn still-extant prayers of the far north, it was born from the Frost Moon's blessings, symbolizing the pure source and the first radiance. Perhaps this is why it finds the tainting of its pale purity with the seven colors of heavenly light unbearable, thus rejecting all life that draws too close.",
