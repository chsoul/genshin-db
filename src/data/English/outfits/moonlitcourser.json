	"description": "Zibai's outfit, made out of silk and hemp. It is said that thousands of years ago, the ancient nation of Lang-Gan possessed exquisite weaving techniques that were brought down to the mortal world by Zibai, a messenger from the high heavens. Ages passed, that old kingdom and its long history faded away, scattered by time until they became as elusive as the moon's reflection on water. Yet their craft has somehow endured. Even now, it still lives on in every pulley and wooden frame of the spinning wheels in Liyue Harbor.",
