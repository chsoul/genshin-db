	"name": "Crowned Eagle",
	"description": "A sharp-eyed eagle whose noble crown further enhances its regal bearing.\nThe Crowned Eagle excels at circling high above its prey, and due to its strong build and wide wingspan, its dive attacks are particularly lethal.\nA faint glow ripples across the Crowned Eagle's feathers due to the influence of kuuvahki. It is a creature that is fiercely proud of its crest — whether it is confronting a rival or resting among its kin, its tall, eminent crown feathers shift with its mood, as though it is quietly declaring its lofty nature.",
