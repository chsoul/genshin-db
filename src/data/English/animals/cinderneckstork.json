	"description": "A bird with a notably graceful form. Its golden-gray feathers accentuate its slender, elegant silhouette.\nWith its exceptional attunement to kuuvahki, the Cinderneck Stork can stalk and strike its prey efficiently, even in the waters of its marshland home.\nHowever, beneath its elegant demeanor hides a strong territorial streak. First-time visitors to the marshes often misinterpret a Cinderneck Stork's warning posture as a dance, leading to unintended confrontations.",
