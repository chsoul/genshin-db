	"description": "A rather agile and flexible gecko. Its toe pads provide enough suction to help it climb up walls.\nThe Thornback Gecko, which feeds on small insects, nests within the crevices of rocky cliffs. A timid creature by nature, it is prone to vanishing into the rocks at the slightest startle.\nThe Thornback Gecko's ridge emits a bright, steady glow due to the influence of kuuvahki. Although this light can sometimes attract bold predators, in most cases, its sharp, blade-like spine is enough to drive them away.",
