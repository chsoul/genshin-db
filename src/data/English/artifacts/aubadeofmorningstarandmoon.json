		"story": "Once there was an age when the silver wheels that guided the primal heavens yet remained three.\nAt that time, the laws bestowed from the heavens had yet to be assembled, and the boundaries of humanity had yet to be defined.\n\nThe sons and daughters of the gods were scattered across the newly-wrought gardens and valleys, their number countless.\nThe envoys of the sky walked among benighted human crowds then, sowing prosperity and wisdom.\nIn the end, the prosperity promised by the gods kindled the flame of intellect, which in turn stirred the whispers of doubt.\n\nIn quest of the answer, the people chose their priests; in fear of the answer, the priests anointed their kings.\nMortal folly stirred the ire of the gods' envoys. Faced with their questions, the divine envoys uttered no word.\nAnd so the people turned their gazes toward the sky, offering sacrifices to the three bright moons in the dark, sunless night.\n\nAbove the night sky, the daughters of dreams and poetry kept vigilant, unceasing watch over the mortal world's every change.\nIn the deep slumber of the Arianrhod Realm, at the foot of the seventy-tiered staircase, beside the gleaming silver vessels.\nUntil they heard that the hearts of these pitiful little humans would also stir with the lunar quakes...\n\nThe night cast its eyes upon the earth, just as the silver stars once lit the way for the dragons' sky-faring ships.\nThey brought madness and inspiration back beneath the moon. It was a reply that Order could not give.\nWhen the morning star rose again, the archpriestess returned from the mountain's summit with a small circular talisman.\nThis \"Moon Wheel\" was the new pact between the three moons and the people."

		"story": "Once there was an age when the silver wheels that guided the primal heavens yet remained three.\nAt that time, The Winged One who tread upon morning stars and dwelt high above the moon became the Lord of the Eternal Heavens.\n\nThe Ark was moored, the matter of creation complete. The mountains and rivers were wrought in their turn.\nBeneath the earth and deep within the seas dwelt the fallen clans and broken kings of the Old World.\nThe Lord of the World within the eggshell drew a false veil to shut out the true, bedeviled skies,\nObscuring dread that once robbed kings of sleep, even those who held dominion over beasts.\n\nThe sun's fierce light swept the heavens clean, but the freshly forged throne still reserved a place in the sky for the Three Sisters of the Moonlit Night.\nPerhaps by its design, even a world where the elements surge in perfect order still needed tides.\nThe Lectors of Thirty Nights knew that alone, they could not protect this lonely, desolate planet from the inevitable doom that approached.\nBefore the coming of the final extinction, no victor in the struggle of good and evil could be worse than the doom of falling together into eternal oblivion.\nPerhaps their former lord, shrouded in mist, would never find the answer. Or perhaps that answer was already at hand.\n\nAs they had hoped, the great ruler of the firmament spurned the destroyer veiled in black mist.\nNo doubt, through its long voyage across the shadowed realms, it had witnessed countless stars meet their end.\nAnd so, they too chose Order. Or, more accurately, made space to accommodate it.\nThat was the age when the three moons shared governance with the morning star. That was the age when Eternity was yet Eternity."

Their dreams and yearnings were known only to the watchful night.\n\nTo draw lost spirits into the moon's gilded halls, a giant silver ship sailed into the harbor of Meropis.\nThe paradise, once hallowed for the life that flows within the breath of the Elements, now opens its gates even to mortals.\nThose who chase the tides laud the Silver King, offering songs and dances to the triple crown of the moonlit night.\nWhen contrasted against the wrathful and merciless Formidable Father, the three moons' gentle light comforted all lost souls like a loving mother.\n\nThus, the peoples of the earth offered their greatest devotion to the Lady Mothers of the Moonlit Night.\nSome would ascend the heights of Vindagnyr, presenting laurel-crowned verses to the bright moons;\nOthers would step into the sacred altar grounds of Lang-Gan, letting finely carved jade accentuate the beauty of the night.\nAnd still others would, in the sacred groves of Arcadia, obtain golden boughs from oakwood.\nBefore the rising of the sun, all desires to defy the heavens were born here.\n\nBut, in the homeland chosen for the children of humankind by the Lord of the Eternal Heavens, moonlight was no more than a single strand of sacred grace.\nTo probe the heavens was forbidden, for every quest beyond the appointed rules led only to destruction.\nFinally, when the long sword at the edge of the world cut across the sky, \"Eternity\" itself reached its end..."
